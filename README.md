# Dockerfiles
This repository keep track of reusable dockerfiles.

## Usage :
See each dockerfile specific readme in folders for usage indications.

## Docker :
If you are not familiar with docker (docker engine, docker hub, dockerfiles, docker images and containers), I suggest you have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) (especially the [dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) part).

I also strongly recommend reading the [best practices for writing dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/) for a better understanding and a cleaner writing of dockerfiles.

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is awesome**, give it a try ;-)
